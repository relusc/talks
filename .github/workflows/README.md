# GitHub Actions workflows

Workflows that I created for the talks/sessions. Folder represent the event they have been created for.

- [`cd-2025-build-push-sample-app.yaml`](./cd-2025-build-push-sample-app.yaml): Used for ContainerDays 2025 session "Securing your Kubernetes supply chain with container image signing". Builds, pushes and signs the container image of the sample application used in the talk.
